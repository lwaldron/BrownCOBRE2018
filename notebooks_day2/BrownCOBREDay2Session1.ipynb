    "\n",
    "This workshop summarizes the main approaches to analyzing sequencing data to obtain per-gene count data, but does not go through how to do it explicitly. It demonstrates approaches to reading, annotating, and summarizing count data using [tximport](http://bioconductor.org/packages/) and various Bioconductor annotation resources, followed by unsupervised exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop uses quotes and materials from [RNA-seq workflow: gene-level exploratory analysis and differential expression](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/rnaseqGene/) by Love, Anders, Kim, and Huber.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Approaches to processing raw data: alignment vs. alignment-free methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational analysis of an RNA-seq experiment begins from the FASTQ files that contain the nucleotide sequence of each read and a quality score at each position. These reads are either **aligned** to a reference genome or transcriptome, or the abundances and estimated counts per transcript can be estimated **without alignment**. For a paired-end experiment, the software will require both FASTQ files. The output of this alignment step is commonly stored in a file format called SAM/BAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNA-seq aligners differ from DNA aligners in their ability to recognize intron-sized gaps that are spliced from transcripts, and their objective of counting transcripts. [Baruzzo et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4106) provide a useful summary of software for aligning RNA-seq reads to a reference genome, and benchmark these using synthetic data for base-level and splice junction precision and recall, sensitivity to tuning parameters, and runtime performance. Some popular alignment-based tools include STAR, TopHat2, Subread, and Novoalign. *de novo* alignment does not use a reference genome: while it offers the possibility of discovering novel transcripts in rearranged genomes and poorly sequenced genomes, it requires more resources and manual effort and is less accurate for known transcripts, and for most people working with model organisms it is probably not a good option. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment-free tools have gained popularity for their fast performance and low memory requirements while maintaining good accuracy.  Instead of directly aligning RNA-seq reads to a reference genome, they perform \"pseudo-alignment\" by assigning reads to transcripts that contain compatible k-mers. The most popular of these tools are [Salmon](https://combine-lab.github.io) and [Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/). These generate a table of read counts directly without the need for a SAM/BAM file as a starting or intermediate step. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily perform RNA-seq alignment in R using [Rsubread](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Rsubread) and [GenomicAlignments](http://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicAlignments), but the rest of this workshop assumes you are starting with the output some sequence analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I would recommend using pseudo-alignment by Salmon [according to this tutorial](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/getting_started/) to process raw reads to TPM. \n",
    "It is a very fast, accurate, well-tested, and well-documented command-line tool. It is\n",
    "especially Bioconductor-friendly, because the \n",
    "[tximport vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html) \n",
    "includes steps to import Salmon results as a *DESeqDataSet* object for use in the [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Annotating and importing expression counts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measures of transcript abundance\n",
    "\n",
    "The differential expression analyses introduced here assume you are analyzing a count table of Transcripts Per Million (TPM) or Counts Per Million (CPM) by samples. Note that while TPM and CPM would order the abundance of different transcripts very differently, for differential expression these differences are not as important. You should **not** use Fragments Per Kilobase per Million reads (FPKM) or otherwise normalize by library size / read depth. The negative binomial log-linear statistical model used by [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2) and [edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/) are intended for use on count data, and achieve better performance than can be achieved with read depth-normalized data. \n",
