    "# Period 4 -  Analyses of ChIP Seq data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "ChIP-seq is a protocol for inferring the locations of proteins bound or associated with DNA. The raw data looks quite different than DNA- or RNA-seq, in that the NGS reads form tall \"peaks\" at the locations where the proteins were tightly bound to DNA in the cells which were used to create the sample. More specifically, ChIP-seq results in two peaks of reads of different strands (plus/minus also referred to as Watson/Crick), as shown in [Figure 1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2592715/figure/F1/) of the MACS manuscript: [Zhang 2008](#foot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most materials come from the [PH525x](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/chipseq/ChIPseq.Rmd) lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Approaches to peak calling and merging\n",
    "\n",
    "## Peak calling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lab, we use the MACS software to call peaks. The code for this is in the [MACS.txt](https://github.com/genomicsclass/labs/blob/master/course7/MACS.txt) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different algorithms for calling peaks, which have varying performance on different kinds of experiments. As mentioned in the lecture, for ChIP of proteins with broad peaks (such as modified histones), algorithms other than those for detecting sharp peaks might perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## After peak calling\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of analyses might be of interest following peak calling. In this lab we will focus on differential binding across samples, by focusing on the peak regions and counting the number of ChIP-seq reads which fall into the peaks for each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motif-finding is common ChIP-seq analysis which is not explored in this course, as we do not cover the basics of analysis of sequences. Motif-finding refers to the task of looking for common strings of DNA letters contained within peaks. These are biologically meaningful, as a number of proteins which are bound to DNA have conformations which make certain strings of DNA letters more preferable for binding. For more references, see the [Footnotes](#foot).\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Calling differential binding across samples\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lab will go over the functionality of the `DiffBind` package, mostly using code from the vignette. This package is useful for manipulating ChIP-seq signal in R, for comparing signal across files and for performing tests of diffential binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading peak files into R\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DiffBind` package provides some called peaks that we can analyze. From the `DiffBind` vignette:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset for this example consists of ChIPs against the transcription factor ERa using five breast cancer cell lines (C.S. Ross-Innes et al, Nature 481(7381):389â€“393, 2012). Three of these cell lines are responsive to tamoxifen treatment, while two others are resistant to tamoxifen. There are at least two replicates for each of the cell lines, with one cell line having three replicates, for a total of eleven sequenced libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Of the five cell lines, two are based on MCF7 cells: the regular tamoxifen responsive line,\n",
    "as well as MCF7 cells specially treated with tamoxifen until a tamoxifen resistant cell line\n",
    "is obtained. For each sample, we have one peakset originally derived using the MACS peak\n",
    "caller (Y. Zhang et al, Genome Biol, 9(9):R137, 2008), for a total of eleven peaksets. Note that to save space in the package, only data for chromosome 18 is used for the vignette."
