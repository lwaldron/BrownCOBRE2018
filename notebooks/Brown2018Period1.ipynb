    "\n",
    "## Motivations and core values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why R?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bioconductor is based on R. Three key reasons for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is used by many statisticians and biostatisticians to create algorithms that advance our ability to understand complex experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is highly interoperable, and fosters reuse of software components written in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is portable to the key operating systems running on commodity computing equipment (Linux, MacOSX, Windows) and can be used immediately by beginners with access to any of these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other languages are starting to share these features.  However the large software ecosystems of R and Bioconductor will continue to play a role even as new languages and environments for genome-scale analysis start to take shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is R?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see more clearly what R is as we work with it.  Two features that merit attention are its approach to *functional* and *object-oriented* programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into these programming concepts, let's get clear on the approach we are taking to working with R.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are using R *interactively* in the Jupyter notebook system for scientific computing\n",
    "- Our interaction with R is defined in notebook \"cells\"\n",
    "- We can put some code in a cell and ask the notebook server to execute the code\n",
    "- If there's an error or we want to modify the cell for some reason, we just change the content of the cell and request a new execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two cells introduce a simple R function and then pose some questions that you can answer by modifying the second cell.\n"

    "### Upshots\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen two important facets of the language/ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "- improvised software creation through user-defined functions\n",
    "- acquisition of complex, biologically meaningful 'objects' and 'methods' with library()\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of library() is essential to acquire access to functions and documentation on library components.  This can be a stumbling block if you remember the name of a function of interest, but not the package in which it is defined.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Another feature worth bearing in mind: all computations in R proceed by evaluation of functions.  You may write scripts, but they will be sequences of function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally: There are many ways of using software in R.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- write scripts and execute them at a command line using Rscript or unix-like pipes.\n",
    "- use a bespoke interactive development environment like Rstudio\n",
    "- use R as a command-line interpreter\n",
    "- use jupyter notebooks\n",
    "- use R through online \"apps\", often composed using the shiny package.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We'll explore some of these alternate approaches as we proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "Bioconductorâ€™s core developer group works hard to develop data structures that allow users to work conveniently with genomes and genome-scale data. Structures are devised to support the main phases of experimentation in genome scale biology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parse large-scale assay data as produced by microarray or sequencer flow-cell scanners.\n",
    "- Preprocess the (relatively) raw data to support reliable statistical interpretation.\n",
    "- Combine assay quantifications with sample-level data to test hypotheses about relationships between molecular processes and organism-level characteristics such as growth, disease state.\n",
    "- In this course we will review the objects and functions that you can use to perform these and related tasks in your own research."
