    "### Why R?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bioconductor is based on R. Three key reasons for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is used by many statisticians and biostatisticians to create algorithms that advance our ability to understand complex experimental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is highly interoperable, and fosters reuse of software components written in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is portable to the key operating systems running on commodity computing equipment (Linux, MacOSX, Windows) and can be used immediately by beginners with access to any of these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other languages are starting to share these features.  However the large software ecosystems of R and Bioconductor will continue to play a role even as new languages and environments for genome-scale analysis start to take shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is R?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see more clearly what R is as we work with it.  Two features that merit attention are its approach to *functional* and *object-oriented* programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into these programming concepts, let's get clear on the approach we are taking to working with R.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are using R *interactively* in the Jupyter notebook system for scientific computing\n",
    "- Our interaction with R is defined in notebook \"cells\"\n",
    "- We can put some code in a cell and ask the notebook server to execute the code\n",
    "- If there's an error or we want to modify the cell for some reason, we just change the content of the cell and request a new execution"
