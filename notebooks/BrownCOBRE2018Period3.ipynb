    "\n",
    "- At the base is the __reference genomic sequence__ for an organism.\n",
    "This is always arranged into chromosomes, consisting of linear\n",
    "sequences of nucleotides.\n",
    "- Above this is the organization of chromosomal sequence into\n",
    "__regions of interest__.  The most prominent regions of interest are\n",
    "genes, but other structures like SNPs or CpG sites are\n",
    "annotated as well.  Genes have internal structure,\n",
    "with parts that are transcribed and parts that are not,\n",
    "and \"gene models\" define the ways in which\n",
    "these structures are labeled and laid out in genomic coordinates.\n",
    "- Within this concept of __regions of interest__ we also identify\n",
    "__platform-oriented annotation__.  This type of annotation is typically\n",
    "provided first by the manufacturer of an assay, but then refined\n",
    "as research identifies ambiguities or updates to\n",
    "initially declared roles for assay probe elements.  The\n",

    "at University of Michigan illustrates this process for affymetrix array annotation.  We \n",
    "address this topic of platform-oriented annotation at the very end of this chapter.\n",
    "- Above this is the organization of regions (most often\n",
    "genes or gene products) into\n",
    "__groups with shared structural or functional properties__.  Examples\n",
    "include pathways, groups of genes found together in cells, or\n",
